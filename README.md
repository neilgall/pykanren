# PyKanren

This is an in-progress attempted Python port of [SwiftyKanren](https://github.com/neilgall/SwiftyKanren) and [KotlinKanren](https://github.com/neilgall/KotlinKanren).

I have been solving some of the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) problems using Prolog, but my knowledge of Prolog is limited and the applicability of it to real-world problems within other language ecosystems is even more limited. A working ÂµKanren in Python with a nice Pythonic API (writing goals as decorated Python functions, for example) would be pretty cool.
